Great questions ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step by step.

## üîπ What is a Mixin?

A **Mixin** is a reusable class that provides additional fields or behavior that you can ‚Äúmix into‚Äù other classes, usually alongside `models.Model`.

* It‚Äôs not a complete model by itself.
* You combine it with other classes to add common functionality without repeating code.
* Example: If you want many models to have `created_at` and `modified_at`, instead of copy-pasting them, you create a `TimestampMixin` and inherit it.

---

## üîπ What does `abstract = True` mean?

In Django, when you define `class Meta: abstract = True` inside a model:

* Django **won‚Äôt create a table** for that class in the database.
* The fields are **inherited** by any model that subclasses it.
* This keeps your database schema clean: no extra tables for mixins or base classes.

So:

```python
class AuditMixin(models.Model):
    modified_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

If you then do:

```python
class Product(AuditMixin, models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

üëâ `Product` will have both `name` and `modified_at` fields, but there‚Äôs **no separate table for AuditMixin**.

---

## üîπ Your Requested Mixin

Here‚Äôs the mixin with the three fields you listed:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class AuditMixin(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)   # Set once when created
    modified_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)      # Updates on each save
    modified_by = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        related_name="modified_%(class)ss"
    )

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

### Usage:

```python
class Product(AuditMixin, models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

Now, `Product` will automatically have:

* `created_at`
* `modified_at`
* `modified_by`

without extra boilerplate.

‚ö° Next Step:
Do you want me to also show you how to **auto-populate `modified_by`** with the logged-in user (via middleware/signals), so you don‚Äôt have to set it manually in every view?
