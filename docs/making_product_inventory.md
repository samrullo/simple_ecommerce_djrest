# About making ProductInventory table to store total inventory of products
That‚Äôs a very good architectural idea üëå ‚Äî and it‚Äôs exactly what some ERP/WMS systems do: they separate **transactional inventory records** (individual batches/lots) from **aggregate product stock levels**.

---

## 1. Your Current Setup

* `Inventory`: batch-level records tied to purchases (needed for FIFO/COGS).
* Stock queries require summing:

```python
Inventory.objects.filter(product=product).aggregate(total=Sum("stock"))
```

This works, but as your dataset grows (many purchases, many products), summing on the fly becomes expensive.

---

## 2. Adding `ProductInventory` Table

A `ProductInventory` model like this:

```python
class ProductInventory(models.Model):
    product = models.OneToOneField(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="inventory_summary")
    total_stock = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.product.name} - {self.total_stock} pcs"
```

### Benefits:

* Quick access: `product.inventory_summary.total_stock` is instant.
* Avoids repeated aggregation queries.
* Scales well if you have thousands/millions of `Inventory` rows.

### Costs/Trade-offs:

* You must **keep it in sync** when stock changes.
* Adds complexity: need signals or transactions that update both `Inventory` and `ProductInventory`.
* Risk of inconsistency if sync fails.

---

## 3. Sync Strategy

You have a few options:

### **a) Signals**

Use `post_save` and `post_delete` signals on `Inventory`:

```python
@receiver([post_save, post_delete], sender=Inventory)
def update_product_inventory(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    total = Inventory.objects.filter(product=instance.product).aggregate(
        total=Sum("stock")
    )["total"] or 0
    ProductInventory.objects.update_or_create(
        product=instance.product,
        defaults={"total_stock": total}
    )
```

### **b) DB Triggers**

Let PostgreSQL handle it with a trigger that updates a summary table whenever `Inventory` changes. This is very efficient but harder to port across databases.

### **c) Scheduled Job**

If slight lag is acceptable, recalc totals with a cron/periodic task (e.g., Celery beat).

---

## 4. Best Practice

* Keep **`Inventory`** for audit and FIFO/COGS.
* Add **`ProductInventory`** for performance if stock queries are frequent.
* Keep it in sync using **signals or DB triggers**.
* Expose only `ProductInventory.total_stock` to the frontend for ‚Äúavailable stock‚Äù.

---

‚úÖ **Answer**: Yes, it makes sense. Keep `Inventory` as is for history/FIFO, and add `ProductInventory` for fast lookups. Just be sure to implement a sync strategy to avoid inconsistencies.

---

Do you want me to draft you a **signal-based implementation** for keeping `ProductInventory` in sync automatically whenever inventory changes?



# Where to write django signals and how to import receiver
Great question üëç Let me break it down step by step.

---

## 1. Where to Define Signals

The common Django practice is:

* Create a file inside your app, e.g. `ecommerce/signals.py`.
* Put your signal receivers there (`update_product_inventory` in your case).
* Make sure Django imports this file on startup, otherwise signals won‚Äôt be registered.
  The easiest way: in your app‚Äôs `apps.py` (e.g. `ecommerce/apps.py`), override `ready()`:

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class EcommerceConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
    name = "ecommerce"

    def ready(self):
        import ecommerce.signals  # noqa
```

This ensures `signals.py` is loaded when Django starts.

---

## 2. How to Write Your Signal

Your `signals.py` could look like this:

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db.models import Sum

from ecommerce.models import Inventory, ProductInventory

@receiver([post_save, post_delete], sender=Inventory)
def update_product_inventory(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    total = Inventory.objects.filter(product=instance.product).aggregate(
        total=Sum("stock")
    )["total"] or 0

    ProductInventory.objects.update_or_create(
        product=instance.product,
        defaults={"total_stock": total}
    )
```

---

## 3. Where to Import `receiver`

The `receiver` decorator is from Django‚Äôs signals system:

```python
from django.dispatch import receiver
```

And for the actual signals (`post_save`, `post_delete`):

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete
```

---

‚úÖ After doing this, every time an `Inventory` row is created, updated, or deleted, your `ProductInventory` table will automatically reflect the summed stock.

---

Do you want me to also show you how to **write a migration to backfill `ProductInventory`** for products that already have inventory records in your DB?
