You're right â€” **Render does not automatically run `python manage.py migrate`** during deployment unless you explicitly tell it to.

To make migrations work during deployment, you have **two main options**:

---

### âœ… Option 1: Use `render.yaml` and `startCommand`

Add a `migrate` step directly to the `startCommand`:

```yaml
startCommand: >
  bash -c "python manage.py migrate &&
           gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000"
```

This ensures migrations are run **every time the service starts**.

> ðŸŸ¡ You can also include `collectstatic` in that chain if you prefer running it at runtime instead of during image build.

---

### âœ… Option 2: Use a Render Job for migrations (preferred in large projects)

Render lets you define **Jobs** in `render.yaml`. These are one-off commands you can run manually or automatically (on deploy).

Example:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: simple-ecommerce
    env: docker
    plan: free
    dockerfilePath: Dockerfile
    buildCommand: ""  # optional if Dockerfile handles it
    startCommand: gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

  - type: job
    name: db-migrate
    env: docker
    plan: free
    dockerfilePath: Dockerfile
    startCommand: python manage.py migrate
    autoDeploy: true
```

You can also create another one for `createsuperuser` and run it manually via the Render dashboard when needed.

---

### âœ… Pro tip (for one-time migration):

If you just want to test migration once, go to Render dashboard:

1. Open your **Web Service**.
2. Go to **Shell** tab or click **"Manual Deploy" > "Shell"**.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

Let me know if you want a `render.yaml` template with `migrate`, `collectstatic`, and Gunicorn all properly handled.


# CORS
The error in your screenshot is:

> **403 Forbidden â€” CSRF verification failed**
> Origin checking failed â€“ `https://simple-ecommerce-djrest.onrender.com` does not match any trusted origins.

This is happening because your `settings.py` is missing the proper trusted host for CSRF protection when hosted on Render.

---

### âœ… Solution: Add `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and update `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

In your `settings.py`, add:

```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://simple-ecommerce-djrest.onrender.com",
]

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "simple-ecommerce-djrest.onrender.com",
    "localhost",
    "127.0.0.1",
]
```

> ðŸ›  You can also use `os.environ.get("RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME")` dynamically in ALLOWED\_HOSTS if deploying across environments.

---

### âœ… Then, rebuild your Docker image and redeploy:

If you're using `render.yaml`, make sure to commit and push the `settings.py` changes, then either:

* **Trigger a manual deploy** on Render
* Or **push a new commit** to GitHub to let Render redeploy automatically

---

Let me know if you want help securing this further for production or applying this conditionally based on environment (e.g., `if os.getenv("RENDER")`).
