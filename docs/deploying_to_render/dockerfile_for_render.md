No, you **do not need to remove the `CMD`** from your `Dockerfile`. In fact, it's a **good practice to keep it**, even when using `render.yaml`.

Here’s why:

---

### ✅ Why keep `CMD` in the Dockerfile?

* **Render's `startCommand` overrides `CMD` at runtime** during deployment.
* But if you (or others) want to run the container locally using `docker run`, the `CMD` will still ensure the app runs correctly.
* This makes your Dockerfile **portable** and **Docker CLI–friendly**, not just Render-specific.

---

### 🔁 Final recommendation:

✅ Keep this line in your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "config.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

✅ And use `startCommand:` in `render.yaml` to override it when needed:

```yaml
startCommand: gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

This way:

* Works on **Render** ✅
* Works with **Docker Compose** ✅
* Works with **`docker build && docker run`** ✅

Let me know if you want to cleanly separate dev and prod setup using something like `Dockerfile.dev` and `Dockerfile.prod`.
