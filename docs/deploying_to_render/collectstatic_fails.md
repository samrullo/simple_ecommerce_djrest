Your error trace clearly indicates the issue:

> **`botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials`**

This means that when `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` is run during your **Docker build**, Django is trying to **access AWS S3** (your static file storage), but **no AWS credentials are available in the environment** at that point.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Happens

When using **`django-storages`** and S3 for `STATICFILES_STORAGE`, Django will attempt to communicate with S3 during `collectstatic`. If your Docker build happens outside of an AWS environment (or without explicitly passed credentials), it fails.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Don‚Äôt Run `collectstatic` During Docker Build**

This is the most common solution for this architecture.

**Change your `Dockerfile`**:

Instead of this:

```dockerfile
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Use this:

```dockerfile
# Remove or comment this line during build
# RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

And **run `collectstatic` only during deployment** (e.g., in your `release` command or Render deploy hook) **where AWS credentials are properly set via environment variables.**

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Provide AWS Credentials During Build** *(Not Recommended for Security Reasons)*

If you really need to run `collectstatic` during the Docker build (e.g., building a static image), you can:

1. Set these **as build args** in your `Dockerfile` or Docker Compose:

   ```dockerfile
   ARG AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   ARG AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ARG AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
   ENV AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   ENV AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ```

2. Pass them during build:

   ```bash
   docker build --build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... --build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... .
   ```

üîí But beware ‚Äî these credentials will be baked into the image unless you're very careful (use `--mount=type=secret`, etc.).

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 3: Use a Local StaticFiles Storage Backend During Build**

Set a **different static storage backend** during Docker build.

You can use environment-based settings in `settings.py`:

```python
if os.environ.get('USE_S3') == 'true':
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
else:
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'
```

Then during your **Docker build**, set:

```dockerfile
ENV USE_S3=false
```

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended: Use Render's `build` and `start` separation

Render supports separating **build commands** and **start commands**.

* Remove `collectstatic` from `Dockerfile`.
* Add this to the **start command or release command** in your Render settings:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

# How to add the command to release section of render
Yes ‚Äî **exactly that!** üéØ

When I said "move the command to Render's release command," what you‚Äôve done in your `render.yaml` using `preDeployCommand` is **the correct and recommended way**.

---

## ‚úÖ Here's What Your `render.yaml` Is Doing:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: simple-ecommerce
    env: docker
    plan: free
    region: oregon
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile

    buildCommand: ""  # ‚úÖ Dockerfile handles build, no need to override
    startCommand: gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

    preDeployCommand: |
      python manage.py migrate
      python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### üîç Explanation:

* ‚úÖ **`buildCommand: ""`**: lets Dockerfile handle everything.
* ‚úÖ **`startCommand`**: runs your app with Gunicorn.
* ‚úÖ **`preDeployCommand`**:

  * Runs **`migrate`**
  * Then runs **`collectstatic`**
  * And this happens **after Docker build** but **before starting the service**, with **your AWS credentials available**, so S3 access will work.

---

## üí° Additional Tips

1. **Make sure your Render environment has these environment variables set:**

   * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   * `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`
   * (Optionally) `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`

   You can set these under:
   **Render Dashboard ‚Üí your service ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Environment Variables**

2. ‚úÖ Remove this from your `Dockerfile`:

   ```dockerfile
   RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

3. ‚úÖ Push your changes to GitHub (or wherever your repo is), and redeploy.

---

## üß™ Verify After Deployment

Once deployed:

* Go to your S3 bucket
* You should see `static/` files freshly updated.
* In browser, test `/admin/` or wherever static files load.

---

Let me know if you'd like me to validate your full `Dockerfile`, `settings.py` config for S3, or anything else!
