# Difference between mixins and generics

In Django REST framework (DRF), **mixins** and **generic views** are two related but distinct concepts used for building API views. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

---

### Mixins

- **Purpose:**  
  Mixins are small, reusable classes that implement a single action or behavior (e.g., listing objects, creating an object, retrieving details, updating, or deleting an object).

- **Examples:**  
  Some common DRF mixins include:
  - `ListModelMixin` – Provides the `list()` method for listing a queryset.
  - `CreateModelMixin` – Provides the `create()` method for creating an instance.
  - `RetrieveModelMixin` – Provides the `retrieve()` method for fetching a single object.
  - `UpdateModelMixin` – Provides the `update()` (and sometimes `partial_update()`) method.
  - `DestroyModelMixin` – Provides the `destroy()` method for deleting an instance.

- **Usage:**  
  Mixins are typically used in combination with a base view class (usually `GenericAPIView`) to compose custom views. This approach is useful when you need finer control over which behaviors you include in your view. For example:

  ```python
  from rest_framework import mixins, generics
  from myapp.models import Product
  from myapp.serializers import ProductSerializer

  class ProductListCreateView(mixins.ListModelMixin,
                              mixins.CreateModelMixin,
                              generics.GenericAPIView):
      queryset = Product.objects.all()
      serializer_class = ProductSerializer

      def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
          return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)

      def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
          return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
  ```

  In this example, you explicitly decide which HTTP methods (GET for listing and POST for creating) are supported by combining the appropriate mixins.

### Generic Views

- **Purpose:**  
  Generic views are high-level classes that are built by combining one or more mixins with a base view (typically `GenericAPIView`). They are designed to handle common API patterns (such as CRUD operations) with minimal boilerplate.

- **Examples:**  
  Some common generic views include:
  - `ListAPIView` – Provides a read-only endpoint for listing objects.
  - `CreateAPIView` – Provides an endpoint for creating an object.
  - `RetrieveAPIView` – Provides a read-only endpoint for retrieving a single object.
  - `RetrieveUpdateAPIView` – Provides endpoints for retrieving and updating an object.
  - `ListCreateAPIView` – Combines listing and creating functionality.

- **Usage:**  
  Generic views let you build standard endpoints quickly. For example, the previous custom view can be replaced by:

  ```python
  from rest_framework import generics
  from myapp.models import Product
  from myapp.serializers import ProductSerializer

  class ProductListCreateAPIView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
      queryset = Product.objects.all()
      serializer_class = ProductSerializer
  ```

  Here, `ListCreateAPIView` is a generic view that internally combines `ListModelMixin` and `CreateModelMixin` with `GenericAPIView`, so you don’t have to write the methods yourself.

### Summary of Differences

- **Granularity:**
  - **Mixins:** Provide individual pieces of functionality. They are lower-level and give you more control when you need to customize behavior.
  - **Generics:** Are higher-level classes that package common combinations of mixins for standard use cases.

- **Boilerplate:**
  - **Mixins:** Require you to explicitly define which HTTP method corresponds to which mixin method.
  - **Generics:** Automatically provide standard method handlers (like `get()`, `post()`, etc.) by combining the mixins with `GenericAPIView`.

- **Customization:**
  - **Mixins:** Are more flexible if you need to deviate from the standard patterns.
  - **Generics:** Are ideal when the standard CRUD patterns suffice, reducing code duplication.

In essence, **generics are built using mixins**. If you need a quick, out-of-the-box solution for a common API pattern, you’d typically use one of the generic views. If you need more customized behavior or want to combine functionality in a non-standard way, you might opt to use the mixins directly along with `GenericAPIView`.
