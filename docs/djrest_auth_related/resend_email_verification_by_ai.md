# How to resend email verification

Yes, you should wrap `allauth.account.utils.send_email_confirmation` in an API view to expose it as an endpoint for resending verification emails. Here's how you can do it properly:

---

### **1. Create the API View**
You need to create a Django REST Framework (DRF) `APIView` to handle the request.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from allauth.account.utils import send_email_confirmation
from allauth.account.models import EmailAddress

User = get_user_model()

class ResendEmailVerificationView(APIView):
    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        email = request.data.get("email")

        if not email:
            return Response({"error": "Email is required"}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

        try:
            user = User.objects.get(email=email)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({"error": "User not found"}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

        # Check if the user's email is already verified
        email_address = EmailAddress.objects.filter(user=user, email=email).first()
        if email_address and email_address.verified:
            return Response({"error": "Email is already verified"}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

        # Resend the verification email
        send_email_confirmation(request, user)

        return Response({"detail": "Verification email has been resent"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

---

### **2. Add the View to `urls.py`**
In your `urls.py`, add the following route:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import ResendEmailVerificationView

urlpatterns = [
    path('auth/resend-email-verification/', ResendEmailVerificationView.as_view(), name='resend-email-verification'),
]
```

---

### **3. Test the API**
You can now test the endpoint using **Postman**, **cURL**, or Django's built-in API browser.

#### **cURL Example**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/resend-email-verification/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "timur@mail.com"}'
```

#### **Expected Responses**
- ✅ **Success (200)**
  ```json
  {"detail": "Verification email has been resent"}
  ```
- ❌ **User Not Found (404)**
  ```json
  {"error": "User not found"}
  ```
- ❌ **Email Already Verified (400)**
  ```json
  {"error": "Email is already verified"}
  ```
- ❌ **Missing Email (400)**
  ```json
  {"error": "Email is required"}
  ```

### **Why This Approach?**
1. **Uses `allauth`'s built-in `send_email_confirmation`**, ensuring consistency with Django Allauth.
2. **Handles errors properly** (e.g., email already verified, user not found).
3. **Secured API endpoint** to avoid spam or abuse.

Would you like to add any authentication or rate limiting to this endpoint?
