Great question üëç ‚Äî what you‚Äôre seeing is very common when sending emails directly from a Django app deployed to Render (or any cloud host). Gmail and other providers often flag these messages as **spam** if the email doesn‚Äôt pass key authentication checks.

---

## üîë Why your emails are going to spam

1. **From address mismatch**
   You‚Äôre sending from `amrulloev.subhon@gmail.com` but the message is being delivered via **Amazon SES (`amazonses.com`)**. Gmail notices this mismatch and suspects spoofing.

2. **No domain authentication**
   You haven‚Äôt set up **SPF**, **DKIM**, and **DMARC** records for your sending domain. Without them, receiving mail servers don‚Äôt trust your emails.

3. **Content/link issues**
   The verification link still points to `http://localhost:3000/...` ‚Äî which also looks suspicious to spam filters.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix Deliverability

### 1. Use a Verified Domain Instead of Gmail

* Don‚Äôt send email ‚Äúfrom‚Äù your Gmail directly.
* Instead, use a domain you own (e.g. `noreply@subkhon.dev` or `support@simple-ecommerce.com`).
* Configure this domain in your email provider (Amazon SES, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun, etc.).

---

### 2. Set Up Email Authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

If you‚Äôre using **Amazon SES** (which `amazonses.com` indicates):

* Go to **AWS SES console**.
* Verify your domain (e.g. `simple-ecommerce.com`).
* SES will give you DNS records:

  * **SPF** (TXT) ‚Üí `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`
  * **DKIM** (CNAME) ‚Üí 3 records for signing
  * **DMARC** (TXT) ‚Üí e.g. `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@simple-ecommerce.com`

Add these records in your domain DNS (Cloudflare, Route53, Namecheap, etc.).

This tells Gmail ‚ÄúAmazon SES is allowed to send mail for my domain.‚Äù

### 3. Fix the Verification Links

Right now the email has:

```
http://localhost:3000/verify-email/...
```

This happens because your Django `SITE_ID` or frontend domain is set to `localhost`.
In `settings.py` add:

```python
FRONTEND_URL = os.environ.get("FRONTEND_URL", "https://simple-ecommerce-djrest.onrender.com")
ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_REDIRECT_URL = f"{FRONTEND_URL}/verify-email"
```

(or adapt depending on whether you use **dj-rest-auth** or **allauth**).

Set `FRONTEND_URL` in Render env vars:

```
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

Now the links will point to the correct deployed frontend, not `localhost`.

---

### 4. Improve Email Headers

* Set a **friendly From name**:

  ```python
  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "SimpleEcommerce <noreply@simple-ecommerce.com>"
  ```
* Include plain-text fallback if you‚Äôre sending HTML.

---

### 5. Optional: Use a Transactional Email Provider

If you don‚Äôt want to manage SES setup, use providers like:

* **SendGrid**
* **Postmark**
* **Mailgun**

They handle authentication + better deliverability.

---

## üöÄ TL;DR

* ‚úÖ Don‚Äôt send from Gmail ‚Üí send from your domain (e.g. `noreply@simple-ecommerce.com`).
* ‚úÖ Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC DNS records for your domain.
* ‚úÖ Fix `localhost` in email links to use your real frontend domain.
* ‚úÖ Configure `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`.
* ‚úÖ Consider a transactional email service (SendGrid/Postmark/Mailgun) if you want ‚Äúit just works‚Äù deliverability.

Do you want me to write you the **exact DNS records for SES (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)** so you can copy them into your DNS provider?
