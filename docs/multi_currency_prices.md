Yes — your design approach **makes very good sense**, especially for a real-world e-commerce system that may handle **multi-currency transactions**. Let’s walk through your idea and I’ll highlight the strengths and a few suggestions for enhancement.

---

## ✅ Summary of Your Design

### 1. **ProductPrice**

* `price`: amount
* `currency`: ForeignKey to `Currency`

👍 This is **correct**. Price should be denominated in a specific currency.

---

### 2. **Currency**

* `code`: e.g., `"USD"`, `"JPY"`
* `name`: e.g., `"US Dollar"`
* You might also want to include: `symbol`, `decimal_places`, `is_active`

---

### 3. **FXRate**

* `currency_from` (e.g., `"USD"`)
* `currency_to` (e.g., `"JPY"`)
* `rate`: `Decimal`
* `start_date`, `end_date`

👍 Perfect. This structure allows you to define historical FX rates.

🔁 **Alternative** (common in finance systems): define **rate as "1 unit of `currency_from` in `currency_to`"**
e.g., USD/JPY = 145.23 → 1 USD = 145.23 JPY

Also consider:

* `source`: string field for tracking where the rate came from (e.g., "ECB", "manual")
* `is_active`: boolean for quick filtering

---

### 4. **Purchase**

* `price_per_unit`
* `currency`: ForeignKey to `Currency`

👍 Correct and important if you allow purchases in different currencies.

---

### 5. **Accounting Currency**

* Define an `ACCOUNTING_CURRENCY` as an environment variable:
  e.g., `ACCOUNTING_CURRENCY="USD"`

🔁 Every **JournalEntryLine** should be denominated in this currency. If a transaction is in a different currency:

* Lookup FX rate valid on transaction date.
* Convert to accounting currency before saving journal entry.

---

## ✅ Benefits of Your Design

* 🔄 **Flexible FX support** — allows historical and multi-currency handling.
* 📒 **Consistent accounting** — everything posted to the ledger is in a single base currency.
* 🔎 **Traceable and auditable** — FX conversions are explicit and backed by FXRate records.
* 📈 **Future-proof** — supports global expansion, reporting in a base currency, and multiple suppliers/vendors.

---

## 🔍 Suggestions

### 1. JournalEntryLine

* Add `original_amount`, `original_currency` to store raw data before conversion.
* Add `converted_amount` = value in accounting currency

### 2. FXRate Query

Make sure you enforce:

```python
FXRate.objects.filter(
    currency_from=X, currency_to=Y,
    start_date__lte=txn_date, end_date__gte=txn_date
).order_by('-start_date').first()
```

### 3. Admin Display

* FXRate admin could benefit from a `__str__` like:

```python
return f"{self.currency_from}/{self.currency_to} @ {self.rate} ({self.start_date} - {self.end_date})"
```

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

This is a **robust, well-structured, and industry-standard approach**. Go ahead with it — you’ll be well-positioned for accounting, analytics, and multi-region scalability.
